My Portfolio Website
From my LinkedIn:
I'm 19 and I'm currently looking for work in the tech Industry. I've recently finished a Udemy.com course for Full Stack Web Development, learning Node.js on the back-end. I studied the course for almost a year and I have made my own portfolio website from the skills I learnt. If you would like to see the specifics of my Tech Stack, refer to my portfolio website at www.tazwin.co.uk. Or alternatively you can check out my CV in the featured section below.

I aspire to be a Full Stack Web Developer and would like to see my career progress to potentially developing AI. I also have major experience in hardware components, the current market for hardware, and building computers for friends and family (my latest personal build is seen on my cover photo, she is named Doville).
I have high levels of motivation to succeed in this industry and would like to progress my skills to the top.
