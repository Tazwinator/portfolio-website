            Hi, i'm Taylor.
            I've been studying Web Development since early September 2020 and have now found myself in love, 
            and obsessed with it.
          </p>
          <p>
<!--             This website is a showcase of a number of the problems I can currently solve.
            What i'm applying for is a developer position, not a designer. If Bob Ross gave me a painting and said 
            "Make a website out if this", I can do it (xD). 
            I'm a problem solver, not an artist. -->
          </p>
          <p>I'm 19 and I'm currently looking for work in the Tech Industry. 
            I've recently finished a Udemy.com course for Full Stack Web Development, 
            learning all the technologies that I have used to create this app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I aspire to be a Full Stack Web Developer and would like to see my career progress to potentially developing AI. 
            I also have major experience in hardware components, the current market for hardware, 
            and building computers for friends and family.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have high levels of motivation to succeed in this industry, and would like to learn what I can, 
            as fast as I can, to see myself be extremely competent in areas of it.

            One day I would like to build an AI, that is indistinguishable from humans, but only superficially.
            It shall be immsensely more intelligent than us. And will be able to do things that might take us a lifetime to do, 
            or potentially never do.
